# A/B Testing Framework

**Goal:** To establish a consistent and data-driven process for optimizing key pages and messages to improve conversion rates (e.g., sign-ups, upgrades).

---

## 1. What to Test

Prioritize tests based on potential impact and ease of implementation. Good candidates include:

*   **Pricing Page:**
    *   Headline and value proposition.
    *   Pricing tiers (e.g., names, features listed, order).
    *   Call-to-action (CTA) button text and color (e.g., "Start for Free" vs. "Get API Key").
    *   Social proof placement.
*   **Homepage:**
    *   Main headline and sub-headline.
    *   Hero section CTA.
    *   Code examples shown.
*   **Email Marketing:**
    *   Subject lines.
    *   CTA in nurture sequences.
*   **Onboarding Flow:**
    *   Clarity of instructions.
    *   Number of steps to get an API key.

## 2. The Process

Follow this four-step process for every test.

### Step 1: Formulate a Hypothesis

Every test must start with a clear hypothesis. Use the following format:

*   **Because we observed (Data/Observation):** [Describe the data or observation that suggests an opportunity. e.g., "Our pricing page has a high bounce rate of 75%."]
*   **We predict that (Change):** [Describe the specific change you will make. e.g., "changing the headline from 'Flexible API Pricing' to 'The Most Affordable Crypto API for Developers'"]
*   **Will cause (Expected Outcome):** [Describe the metric you expect to change. e.g., "will decrease bounce rate and increase clicks on the 'Sign Up' button."]
*   **We will measure this with (Metric):** [The specific KPI to measure. e.g., "a 10% increase in the sign-up button click-through rate."]

### Step 2: Implement the Test

*   **Tools:**
    *   **Google Optimize:** A free and powerful tool for A/B testing web pages.
    *   **Feature Flags:** For more complex tests involving application logic, use a feature flagging service (e.g., LaunchDarkly) or a simple homegrown solution.
    *   **Email Marketing Tools:** Most email platforms (e.g., Mailchimp) have built-in A/B testing for subject lines and content.
*   **Duration:** Run the test long enough to achieve statistical significance (usually at least 2-4 weeks, depending on traffic).

### Step 3: Analyze the Results

*   Once the test concludes, analyze the data.
*   Did the variation win, lose, or was it inconclusive?
*   Look for a confidence level of 95% or higher to declare a winner.
*   Analyze secondary metrics. Did the change have any unintended negative consequences?

### Step 4: Learn and Iterate

*   **If the hypothesis was correct:** Implement the winning variation for 100% of traffic.
*   **If the hypothesis was incorrect:** Revert to the original. Document the learnings. Why do you think it failed? What does this tell you about your users?
*   **Inconclusive:** Form a new hypothesis and re-test with a more dramatic change.

## 3. Tracking

*   Maintain a central document or spreadsheet (e.g., in Notion or Google Sheets) to track all A/B tests.
*   **Columns:** Test Name, Hypothesis, Start Date, End Date, Status (Running, Complete), Results, Key Learnings, Next Steps.
