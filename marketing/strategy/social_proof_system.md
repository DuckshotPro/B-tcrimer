## 1. Collection Methods

### a) Automated Email Requests
*   **Trigger:** 30 days after a user signs up AND has made > 1000 API calls.
*   **Tool:** Marketing automation software (e.g., Customer.io, Mailchimp).
*   **Email Template:**
    *   **Subject:** Got a minute? How has your experience been with B-TCrimer?
    *   **Body:** "Hi {{firstName}}, you've been using our API for about a month now, and we'd love to hear your feedback. If you have a moment, would you be willing to share a sentence or two about your experience? We might feature it on our website!"
    *   **Incentive (Optional):** "As a thank you, we'll add a $10 credit to your account for any testimonial we feature."

### b) Proactive Social Media Monitoring
*   **Tool:** Twitter search, TweetDeck, or a social listening tool.
*   **Process:** Regularly search for mentions of "B-TCrimer" or people discussing problems our API solves. When you find someone saying something positive, reply and ask for permission to use it as a testimonial.
*   **Example Reply:** "Thanks for the kind words, @user! We're so glad you're enjoying the API. Would you mind if we featured this tweet on our homepage?"

### c) Direct Outreach for Case Studies
*   **Trigger:** Identify power users or businesses building interesting applications on the API (via internal dashboards).
*   **Process:** Send a personal email offering to feature their project in a case study on the B-TCrimer blog.
*   **Value Proposition for Them:** "We'll promote the case study to our audience of [Number] developers and traders, which can drive traffic and awareness for your project."

## 3. Display & Usage

Once collected and stored, social proof should be integrated across all marketing materials.

*   **Homepage:** A rotating carousel of 3-5 top-tier testimonials.
*   **Pricing Page:** Place relevant testimonials next to each pricing plan to overcome specific objections.
*   **Blog Posts:** Embed quotes from users within relevant articles.
*   **Social Media:** Create "Testimonial Tuesday" posts with nicely designed graphics for each quote.
*   **Case Studies:** In-depth articles on the blog showcasing how a specific customer achieved success with the API. These are your most powerful marketing assets for converting large customers.
*   **Email Sequences:** Include a short testimonial in nurture emails.
