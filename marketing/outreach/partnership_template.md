**Subject:** Collaboration idea for {{partnerName}} & B-TCrimer

**Body:**

Hi {{contactName}},

My name is [Your Name] and I'm the [Your Title] at B-TCrimer, a crypto data API for developers and traders.

I've been following {{partnerName}} for a while and was really impressed with [mention something specific, e.g., "your recent article on DeFi trends" or "the clean UI of your platform"].

Our audiences seem to have a lot in common - developers and traders who are serious about crypto. I had an idea for a collaboration that could be mutually beneficial.

We could [propose a specific idea]:

*   Host a joint webinar showing how to use our API with your platform.
*   Feature {{partnerName}} in our newsletter to our [Number] subscribers.

Would you be open to a brief chat next week to explore this?
